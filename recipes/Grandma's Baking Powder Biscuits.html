        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is my grandmother's biscuit recipe. It is my all-time favorite and has a really good flavor to it. Be sure not to roll out too thin, you want high biscuits! I usually just pat out the dough to the desired thickness, usually 1/2 inch.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt into a bowl. Use a pastry cutter to chop vegetable shortening into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk egg and milk together in a separate bowl and slowly add milk mixture to flour mixture, stirring as you pour, until dough is moistened and well-mixed. Drop dough by spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits have risen and are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
